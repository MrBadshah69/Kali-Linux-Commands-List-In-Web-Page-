    <h2>Same Exmaple</h2>

    <h3>COMMAND: ls</h3>
    <pre>
The command “ls” stands for (List Directory Contents), List the contents of the folder, 
be it file or folder, from which it runs. The most common options are -a (all files) 
and -l (long or details) Tab completion is supported and may be configured with 
.inputrc
</pre>
<pre>
When output to file the files are listed one per line. 
By default, colour is not used to distinguish types of files. 
That is equivalent to using -- color=none. Using the
--color option without the optional WHEN argument is 
equivalent to using --color=always. With --color=auto, 
color codes are output only if standard output is connected to a terminal (tty).
</pre>

<br>

<h2>Command: lsblk</h2>

<pre>
The “lsblk” stands for (List Block Devices),print block devices
by their assigned name (but not RAM) on the standard output in a 
tree-like fashion.
</pre>

<img width="500" height="200" src="image/C Pic.JPG" alt="C PIc">
<br>
<pre>
he “lsblk -l” command list block devices in „list„ structure (not tree 
like fashion).

Note: lsblk is very useful and easiest way to know the name of New 
Usb Device you just plugged in, especially when you have to deal 
with disk/blocks in terminal.
  
</pre>

<h2>Command: sudo</h2>
<pre>
  he “sudo” (super user do) command allows a permitted user 
  to execute a command as the superuser or another user, 
  as specified by the security policy in the sudoers list.

  exp: root@Kali:~# sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa

  Note: sudo allows user to borrow superuser privileged, while a similar command „su„ allows user to actually log
  in as superuser. Sudo is safer than su.
  It is not advised to use sudo or su for day-to-day normal use, as it can result
  in serious error if accidentallyyou did something wrong, that‟s why a 
  very popular saying in Linux community is:

  “To err is human, but to really foul up everything, you need root password.”
  
</pre>

 <h2>Command: mkdir</h2>
 <pre>
The “mkdir” (Make directory) command create a new directory with name path. 
However is the directory already exists, it will return an error 
message “cannot create folder, folder already exists”.

exp: root@Kalitut:~# mkdir Kalitut

Note: Directory can only be created inside the folder, in which 
the user has write permission. mkdir: cannot create directory `Kalitut„: 
File exists (Don‟t confuse with file in the above output, 
you might remember what i said at the beginning – 
In Linux every file, folder, drive, command, scripts are treated as file).
</pre>
<h2>Command: chmod </h2>
<pre>
The Linux “chmod” command stands for (change file mode bits). 
chmod changes the file mode (permission) of each given file, 
folder, script, etc.. according to mode asked for.There exist 
3 types of permission on a file (folder or anything but to 
keep things simple we will be using file).
        
          Read (r)=4 
          Write(w)=2 
          Execute(x)=1

So if you want to give only read permission on a file it 
will be assigned a value of „4„, for write permission only,
a value of „2„ and for execute permission only, a value 
of „1„ is to be given. For read and write permission 4+2 = „6„ 
is to be given, ans so on.

Now permission need to be set for 3 kinds of user and usergroup. The first 
is owner, then usergroup and finally world.

        rwxr-x--x	abc.sh

Here the root‟s permission is rwx (read, write and execute).
usergroup to which it belongs, is r-x (read and execute only,
no write permission) and


for world is –x (only execute).

To change its permission and provide read, write and execute 
permission to owner, group and world.

  root@Kali:~# chmod 777 abc.sh 

  only read and write permission to all three.

    root@Kalitut:~# chmod 666 abc.sh

read, write and execute to owner and only execute to group and world.
   root@Kalitut:~# chmod 711 abc.sh

Note: one of the most important command useful for sysadmin 
and user both. On a multi-user environment or on a server, 
this command comes to rescue, setting wrong permission will
either makes a file inaccessible or provide unauthorized 
access to someone
</pre>

<h2>Command: tar</h2>

<pre>
The “tar” command is a Tape Archive is useful in creation of archive, 
in a number of file format and their extraction.

  root@Kali:~# tar -zxvf abc.tar.gz (Remember 'z' for .tar.gz) 

  root@Kali:~# tar -jxvf abc.tar.bz2 (Remember 'j' for .tar.bz2) 
  
  root@Kali:~# tar -cvf archieve.tar.gz(.bz2) /path/to/folder/abc

Note: A „tar.gz„ means gzipped. „tar.bz2„ is compressed with 
bzip which uses a better but slower compression method.
</pre>

<h2>Command: cp</h2>
<pre>
The “copy” stands for (Copy), it copies a file from one 
location to another location.

  root@Kali:~#         cp          /home/user/Downloads          abc.tar.gz
  /home/user/Desktop (Return 0 when sucess)


Note: cp is one of the most commonly used command in 
shell scripting and it can be used with wildcard characters
(Describe in the above block), for customised and desired file copying.
  
</pre>

<h2>Command: mv</h2>
<pre>
The “mv” command moves a file from one location to another location.

    root@Kali:~#	mv	/home/user/Downloads	abc.tar.gz
    /home/user/Desktop (Return 0 when sucess)

Note: mv command can be used with wildcard characters. 
mv should be used with caution, as moving of 
system/unauthorised file may lead to security as well 
as breakdown of system.
</pre>

<h2>Command: pwd</h2>
<pre>
The command “pwd” (print working directory), prints 
the current working directory with full path name 
from terminal.

    root@Kali:~# pwd
    /home/user/Desktop

Note: This command won‟t be much frequently used in 
scripting but it is an absolute life saver for 
newbie who gets lost in terminal in their early 
connection with nux. (Linux is most commonly referred
as nux or nix).
</pre>

<h2>Command: cd</h2>
<pre>
Finally, the frequently used “cd” command stands for 
(change directory), it change the working directory 
to execute, copy, move write, read, etc. from 
terminal itself.

    root@Kali:~# cd /home/user/Desktop 
    server@localhost:~$ pwd
    /home/user/Desktop

Note: cd comes to rescue when switching between 
directories from terminal. “Cd ~” will change 
the working directory to user‟s home directory, 
and is very useful if a user finds himself lost 
in terminal. “Cd..” will change the working 
directory to parent directory (of current 
working directory).
